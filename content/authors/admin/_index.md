I'm a Master student in Statistical Science at Ghent University, a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and an Affiliate at the [**Stanford Data Science Center for Open and Reproducible Science**](https://datascience.stanford.edu/cores) (SDS-CORES). I'm interested in Organizational Behavior, with a special interest in Groups and Teams and Leadership. In addition to my substantive work in Organizational Behavior, I'm interested in meta-science and methods. In my free time, I enjoy deadlifting, hiking, and taking board games much too seriously. 

I'm always looking for ways to contribute to large-scale efforts that aim to improve the rigor and reproducibility of (behavioral) science. For example, I'm a Project Manager of the [**Replications & Reversals**](https://forrt.org/reversals/) project at [**FORRT**](https://forrt.org) (Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training); I'm an ex-officio member of the [**Executive Board**](https://improvingpsych.org/board/) of [**SIPS**](https://improvingpsych.org) (The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science); and I'm a Team Lead at the [**NASA TOPS (Transform to Open Science) Mission**](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science), where I lead a team of subject-matter experts in developing a curriculum on Open Science Tools and Resources. I’m also actively involved with the [**Center for Open Science DARPA-SCORE**](https://www.cos.io/score) project as a Reproduction and Replication Analyst and Auditor.  

My favorite letter in the alphabet is R, and I am weirdly evangelical about it. I co-teach Data & Decisions --- a graduate-level, introductory class on probability and statistics using <i class="fab fa-r-project" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#035AA6"></i> --- and I'm a co-organizer of the [**Stanford Data Science for Social Good**](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program) program. I learn by teaching, so I consider myself very lucky!
